Edyth's council:
Edyth: How did you publish something so revolutionary?
Author: I just took a risk. I still had to play the game, so it's not as revolutionary as you think. I had to make compromises in what I wanted to say so that powerful people would still like me.
Author: And at the same time, slip secret notes to the reader. And it helped that I was a nobody, Nobody really read this besides you.

Edyth and Ama:
Ama: Men are scum. All you can do is use them before they use you.

Roadtrip:
Zack: If fun were food, I'd never starve.
Zack: That just isn't fun.
Edyth: I'm not concerned with fun.

Zack: I'm worried about dying.
Edyth grew up constantly having to think about death. 
Edyth: Everyone does it, even people younger than you do it. The best thing you can do is decide how you want to feel about it.
