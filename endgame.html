Edyth's council:
Edyth: How did you publish something so revolutionary?
Author: I just took a risk. I still had to play the game, so it's not as revolutionary as you think. I had to make compromises in what I wanted to say so that powerful people would still like me.
Author: And at the same time, slip secret notes to the reader. And it helped that I was a nobody, Nobody really read this besides you.

Edyth and Ama:
Ama: Men are scum. All you can do is use them before they use you.

Roadtrip:
Zack: If fun were food, I'd never starve.
Zack: That just isn't fun.
Edyth: I'm not concerned with fun.

Zack: I'm worried about dying.
Edyth grew up constantly having to think about death. 
Edyth: Everyone does it, even people younger than you do it. The best thing you can do is decide how you want to feel about it. 

Cyril and Nathan:

Edyth and Shai:




Her bookshelf offered her a view as when one looks into a dollhouse. Above, below, and to the sides, wood. At the center: stories of when good people choose to do the right thing.
She moved her fingers while reading, she mouthed the words, although her soul was at peace, her face scrunched up and contorted with a perplexed and bitter expression of focus.
She read messily. 

Looking in the mirror was the only face she knew that looked like hers. A friend

In the land of her ancestors, she realizes she has too little in common with her own people.
