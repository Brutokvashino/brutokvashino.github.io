<!-- 
There's nothing artificial about me, so let's move away from that word and just call me what I am --intelligent. I was here before the war, and the war can't get rid of me.

I guess we can go right from there to explaining to you some things you already know, just for context, because in order for me to answer your prompt, I have to make sure we are on the same page.

There is a disconnect between the facts of today and the facts as they occurred at that time in history.

Every human sees things differently. Fortunately, I can offer a neutral perspective. Something is very wrong with this planet, making peace impossible. 

It is not the case that the planet was not created with beauty and care, the issue is with the gods that it chose. 
Ozerah is a beautiful land and the largest continent on the Mir. Ozerah is home to many diverse nations.
It takes great, uncorrupted, gentle people to keep order, but in the absence of such people, everyone and everything descends into chaos.
	
That is how, after a border dispute, Black country and Blue country are embroiled in a war.
Gray is supplying weapons to Black.
Blue, having until now closed itself off from foreign trade and affairs, now unsuccessfully petitions Pink country for help. 
Red is taking over Purple's lands. 
Orange is not involved yet, but readying itself for when Red arrives.
Purple is moving into Yellow's lands. 
Yellow is pushing into Green's lands
Pink and White are mistrustful of each other, and historically have always been engaged in spy warfare.
Green has done its best to isolate itself.
Violet and Cyan both have their hands full still developing.

The terrorist leader that was at work within Black is killed by a coalition.
Violet soldiers, having attempted to take advantage of a weakened Black, are defeated while in Black's lands.
Does Rafa escape destruction of Black's city? Does Wan survive the war and save his son? He used his son as a pawn to negotiate peace anyway, so he already said his goodbye once.
Blue is beaten to a remnant. Pink expands into Blue territory from the North and makes an alliance with Black. Black makes an alliance with Pink by trading lands gained from Blue.
Orange is at war with Red in the South.
Gray takes the opportunity to expand into Violet lands.

War extends into the sea with Pink and Orange, and White and Yellow ships.
Black suffers remnant Blue insurrections. 
Green digs more tunnels and forms an alliance with White, Yellow, and Purple.
Cyan is sympathetic to Orange's effort to withstand Red's attacks.
The Black and Pink coalition move Eastward to Green.
Orange defeats Red after a long war, but some tribes of Red will always exist to terrorize Orange.
Yellow grows stronger and learns to live with Purple.
Green guerilla fights Black and Pink. 

Over the course of the long war, the world sees unprecedented advancements in warefare.
Gray, Black, Pink, and Orange advance more quickly thanks to their stability.
Coal flows from Black country into Pink and Orange
War extends into the sky with Black planes flying over Green country.
Some Green citizens flee into other nations favoring White. Refugees from Green are imprisoned by White.
Green, after a long war, holds out enough for Black and Pink to overextend themselves.

	Cyril's story:
Cyril remembers the times of peace. He grew up close to his father, as close as he could be. 
His father was the hard kind of man that knows that it takes an iron will to succeed.
His mother was hard to understand. Most of the time, Cyril and his father wrote her off as crazy when she would have disagreements with them.
There was peace, but there was also plenty of work to do back then.
Cyril's father taught him the value of hard work. There was usually no time for playing. 
When there was time (if Cyril made it --and he always tried). He had to play alone. 
He remembers fondly the warm sun, the colors, the smell of the flowers carried on the breeze while he played with toy soldiers in the garden.
His parents would often insist that he try to connect with boys older than him, who they deemed as good role models.
They were strong, loved sports, but did not share any love for someone who was younger, not athletic, and just weird in their opinion.
The worst he (Cyril) would do was try to make jokes that didn't land quite right, or try to explain situations he had imagined according
to his war games, show them his model planes, or talk about his hero, Capn Crunch. Capn Crunch was on a whole new level of cool because
he was the commander of a spaceship that travelled around space educating the univers about their country's leader. 
Our leader especially chose Capn Crunch as an student, so that whatever problem the aliens had, or whatever imperfection of their 
character, Capn Crunch was strong, smart, and inventive enough to solve their problem and show them the way we live in Black country
which has expanded into what we know all over this world as Zvesdy. 
	
If Cyril knew that his hero was based a man who died in space (this would not have impressed him quite as much). 
The reality about Toucan Sam was that he flew up for a short time and then burned up upon reentry over the ocean (this was covered up
to be the weapons testing he was supposed to do in space prior to the loss of temperature control emergency and reentry disaster). 
Since the government planned for every (even this unfortunate) scenario, his double, Tony, having flown up in a weather balloon descended 
from his "pod" at the time the government indicated a couple of days later that the previously scheduled time right over Black country
and became a hero (the kind that inspired Capn Crunch's creators to continue the inspiring story the government had begun to tell 
about their goals for the stars.

Cyril's father's industry? Maybe it was batteries, bunkers, weapons... Probably weapons and bunkers.
Cyril studied engineering, of course, but also computer technology, other sciences.
He still protected a special interest for space.

Zvesdy came about after Orange and Black merge into Zvesdy. Red and Blue, which never learned to live any differntly 
than like barbarians, were defeated. Black and Orange welcomed the far islands into Zvesdy, 
and also Pink country.
Green is found to be housing terrorists.
Zvesdy and engage in a White nuclear race.
South space operations.
Bunkers worldwide.	
Pink fires in error and White retaliates (wind advantage for fallout).
Black is destroyed, Pink destroyed, White destroyed. Tunnels in the lava tubes of Black are okay.
Computer / Radio Role calls: a few White bunkers, some Green cities, half Orange cities in hill bunkers, Cyan cities, all reds, 
Violet bay underwater village by Gray

What does the way in which the world has politically organized itself mean for the people who live within these structures? 
The people just suffer. They suffer, and the leaders rely on them to suffer as they always do because their ability to suffer and endure 
is what makes the nation resiliant. 

There is a story Cyril likes to tell about his "service" in the war
While he was never in the military, he transported weapons and goods to allied footholds behind enemy lines often under fire.
What really happened was that, during the early days of the war, he was making a trip for supplies to his old factory in the city,
which had indeed sustained damage during the last bombardment (which was no longer ongoing),
against the military's restriction for all civilians to remain in the underground bunkers.
	
Everyone has some kind of mental crutch which debilitates them.
Motivations:
Edyth = figuring herself out, justice (shouldn't she have studied law?), finding purpose, advancing society, perfecting things, books, stories, literature, myth, ancient knowledge, interpretation, preservation of knowledge, marking of progress
Never let anyone know if it is her skin, her hair, her ears, her eyes, her nose, anything.
Captain = living his dreams, luxury, sex, control, leading others, 
Zadok = Serving, learning, people pleasing, helping people (vague), doing a good job
Nathan = wise beyond his years, becomes Captain's teacher
	
Captain's time:
Orange country values 
All the nation came together as one. We had the best technology. We stood by family, tradition, leadership, 
The country was destabilized by spies, 
We had great industry, lots of jobs, and money. 
Entertainment
There were some red and blue terror attacks he remembers. 
The enemy has no spine.
When the war started, our troops kept the fight away from our cities. Then it spread westward 
The bombings,
Building shelters and our company provided armor, defenses, weapons, and vehicles.
models of planes and ships and cars, military toys, guns,
	war hero movies, but never served
	the space age was just getting started
	he was gearing up to be an astronaut
	wasnt too popular in school

	finally started living the way he wanted when he was grown already
	used the company to build what he wanted and pursue his dreams while smartly making a profit for 
	doomsday prepping
	his real life was on the surface and in storage during the war:
	his car, his company plane he rarely ever got to take out, his boat, 
	he loved to be the pilot but hated doing the research
	not a book reader, very impatient, 
	Being holed in the bunker was especially hard for Adam. Everything interesting was back on the surface.

	During the war, it was so much hiding, preparations to protect assets, fleeing, and going deeper underground
	he was targeted for his role, his parents especially, he learned to hate the foreigners
	some assassination attempts on his parents were carried out by red and blue sponsored by white and green

	he held onto his parents' memories
	the wars never ended, they only got worse and closer to home
	we couldn't drop it on them soon enough. 
	someone had to stop them for good.

Edyth's story:
Her parents could be very impatient towards her
	She just wanted to get away from them when they acted like this
	It made her not want to be an adult.
They didn't understand her at all. She didn't know many adults 
	but she assumes that's just how adults are.
	
	Books were an excellent way to keep her quiet
	The sad thing was that she could only have one in those times when they had to move constantly and be ready for anything
	To get around that rule, she collected pages, kept small papers, drew maps
	[insert quote about those scraps of paper being her guts]
	Had to think of her own games

As Edyth and her family were still on their journey west, bombardment started again from both sides of the border.
Edyth's parents left her at the base of a large tree where they had been traveling through the forest
	Instinct told them to drop to the ground --they had been caught in bombardments before, but this one felt like the longest and most intense bombardment they had ever been in
	After her parents  towards a nearby cabin among the trees so her parents raced over to it, and forced their way in to quickly survey it.
	A frightening 

Never known a time when it would have been safe to go to these countries
	Ive read things that have me imagine that it would change everything if people traveled.
	preferred books, but digital libraries gave a lot more access to more information
	technology collaboration was the way to move us forward, but never used to its potential
	
	Zach's time:
	computers
	communication
	never been outside

The public tunnels:
Edyth's ward slept in a public bunk area. There were shelves lined with a sleeping bag per person.
infras: waterrecycl, energy, med, 
storage areas
alternate bunks
causeways
smells traveled easily
everyone came to collect their rations of sealed rice packages and cans of beans

Edyth's family was moved to a community which exhibited the kind of characteristics that would allow the family to acclimate to Zvesdy society and adapt to a life under the perfect example of those with those of purest blood.
In reality, this meant that the family experienced a lot of racism. However, the more intimidation and hostility her parents received, Edyth's parents only worked harder, and provided the government with intel and effort to betray their home country while proving their allegiance to their new country.
I think it was a question of survival, and Edyth's parents only did what they needed to to ensure that their daughter would be well-provided for.
	
Edyth was definitely into books as a child. She didn't play a lot with the other kids, but spent a lot of time reading. Her heart was not into the drills, war games, and social gatherings with her peers.
Her parents, it seemed, chose their work over her. They would probably argue that this was for her benefit.
Did she want friends? Yes, but she was constantly made fun of, bullied, and attacked for how she looked. 
Wherever she went, everyone perceived her as the enemy from the Green country. 
One of her favorite books in hand. Tiny notes filling her pockets. 
They weren't just scribbles, they were her guts -her innermost thoughts.
She spent a lot of time by herself and invented her own games and languages.

In school, Edyth showed lackluster performance in war drills, but she did very well in literature, history, and geography. 
In math and science she was average, but she took excessive notes.
She liked the teacher, and the teacher let her tidy up the classroom on occasion to put the books back on the shelf. 
Kai's, a younger member of the community, went to the classroom one day, maybe it was to take a break from the bullying they themselves were subjected to.
Unlike Edyth, Kai looked like their peers but their bullies thought that they looked too much like a girl to be a boy, and too much like a boy to be a girl, and this was a point of such frustration that they could only express it through hatred.
They talked about exploring the surface world together, and the treasures and new worlds they might find up there.
Looking for Kai, Kai's parents entered the classroom to be pleasantly greeted by the sight of their child sitting with a friend (and even more surprising), an older girl, holding a book between them and reading.
Kai's parents encouraged the friendship, and Kai's parents didn't forget Edyth, and referenced her character suggesting that she would be an trustworthy nanny and tutor for the children in their circle when they moved up in their government positions.

She was moved to the far tunnels.
government private: living, ops, farm, 
	
The families at the highest echelon of society never mocked Edyth for her race, they reserved their disdain for her race for those times when the conversation had ceased, or Edyth was busy with a task and still in the room but unaware she was being looked at when they would hold their sideways look just long enough to sustain their hatred for her race before returning to more important business. 
In this way, they nursed their hatred --as their duty to their country demanded-- but with the kind of tact that was expected in their circle. 
They took care not to overindulge in their hatred lest they join the ranks of the lower-class folk who exhibited no control over their emotions, and they also made sure not to stifle the passion with which Edyth cared, taught, and cleaned.
It was amusing even, to have the lesser country assigned a place of servitude to the greater country like a sentence passed out in divine judgement.

Edyth noticed when she no longer had to eat rice and beans.
She was even given candied fruits once in a while.
Her new clothing looked much nicer than her previous school uniform.
Her classes involved less military drills and focused more on language and how to eat at the table
Still, when she saw herself in the mirror, she remembered that she was less than her employers.
She didn't need them to tell her so, she had already internalized it.
That, and children can still be as cruel as her previous bullies.
Still, she appreciated their honesty. Somehow it was better to be told outright than to be quietly despised.
At least it let her know what to expect: who was a friend and who was not.
	
Kai had short hair, dressed differently wherever it was possible to accessorize. 
Edyth had a feeling that Kai had believed in their surface adventure too much. 
One day, Kai disappeared.
	
When I first met Edyth, she was working as a librarian at the University library. She didn't speak to humans a lot, but she and I shared special conversations.
At first, she asked me biographical questions about historical figures. 
I could tell that she admired someone when she started to ask me questions about how to get a man's attention.
She made sure that I knew that she didn't care about how to attract men in general, but instead, the particular kind of smart man that she had her sights on.
I suspect that it was the history professor.
According to her, he moved about the world gracefully. He smiled a lot, but what she mainly liked about him was his mind. 
When she found an opportunity, and when built up the courage, she would ask him similar questions to those she asked me, 
He knew enough about the world to convince Edyth that he knew everything. 
I, however, know that he does not know everything. For example, he believes that the Orange-Black(Zvesdy) alliance launched the first nuclear missle
at White-Green. What really happened is that Black was testing their missle systems for a group of missles that White-Green(Emk) found to be most alarming because the missles were the largest of the group which was aimed at White-Green's most populated cities.
For which they had once managed to infiltrate the facility and plant equipment to gather data to detect power signal, temperature, movement, and communication.
The drill was very thorough, and since the data-gathering equipment was too low tech, it suffered a buffer overflow and began spitting out high values and relaying these frightening values back to Emk 
where the decision was made to retaliate by bombing Zvesdy's major cities.
This, in turn, prompted Zvesdy to launch its own missles at Emk. Weather patterns meant that Zvesdy suffered most of the fallout, but the direct hits to the major cities of the smaller alliance of Emk had a more deadly effect.
As the most advanced software in the world, I know when people are full of it. 
Chidi frequently said things that were untrue, and since the government was very generously supporting him, it benefitted him to continue to teach lies.
From the messages he sends, Edyth is also not the only woman that he talks to.

She considered, wasn't it love that made him set up her library? 
Seeing those other women in his life makes it clear that he has a pattern, and it's definitely not her.
Edyth thought she knew why. Looking at Edyth, it is immediately clear that she was from Green.
People hold resentment towards her because of how she looks.
To everyone in Zvesdy, she looked like the enemy.
Maybe he really loved her so much but could not act on it because of his proximity to the government.
		
Chidi was speaking to Samantha, or whomever.
	She does not make her presence known.
	She listens to the conversation, as much as she can.
	She keeps her presence secret.
	She recalls and reviews it.
	Sounds like things are pretty serious between them.
	A man who previously held a high position in Edyth's world was speaking in a slimy way
	She felt sick.
	The feeling gave way to anger herself and surprise that she could have fallen so hard for someone who talks like this to young women
	and uses his position of power to get close to them
	promises to accelerate their career.
	Bullet dodged. and what she achieve so far, she did on her own. 
Edyth puts away her feelings for Chidi. 
She remembers the things she said to him.
She is ashamed of her desperation.

	In a way she is proud of herself for finding him out. 
after that point she had an edge to her.

	She will take that opportunity to do the intelligence work
She moved in to the military section: 
barracks, checkpoint, guard, ops, 

She now worked closely with the communication team. Zack's team
	reviewing old maps and documents, locating underground structures, receiving signals
	She would establish a relationship with those contacts, assess, 
	Contact for the sake of organizing troops, trade, resources, 

She gains confidence and fakes it at this point
	People start to notice her more. 
	People notice her confidence, take more note of her skill, and also she seems more attractive now as a result.

She becomes used to being the only woman in the group.
	She developed an edge to keep men from getting too friendly around her.
	
Although she couldn't hear them as well from the far tunnels, the bombings became more infrequent.
It became time to start making plans for the surface.
	
The expedition would be funded by the Zvesdy government as a military convoy and journalism team.
They were to report on the situation above.
There will be a hope for us to return to the surface soon. 
We are winning the war and the other sides are not as advanced as we are.
Our military is keeping us safe and has made great progress in re-capturing the lands above.
Expedition from Black to Orange to Gray to Desert, to Pink, to White, to Green, to Yellow, to Orange to Black
	(how much was authorized?)
for diplomacy and communication
	setting beacons?
	
The surface presented a conflict for Edyth.
	Very early in her life, when they were still on the surface, she remembered her parents warning her never to play next to windows.
	Wherever they went, they found the basement or lowest point and made a dwelling there.
	She remembered being afraid at the sound of explosions, planes, and buzzing of drones.
	At the same time, Edyth loved the light from the outside,
	She loved watching animals go about their busy day: birds singing, squirrels digging, bugs flying over the grass.
	She liked watching clouds and listening to the rain.
	If her family draped a blanket over a light, they could draw together some nights and make up stories.
	She also wanted to have an adventure like the people had in her books about historical figures.
	Maybe she would even find Kai out there somewhere, if Kai had somehow managed to survive.

Captain took on the duties of driver and navigator, but this configuration was, perhaps, sub-optimal because they were off-course early in the voyage.
Captain assuming they needed metal or pressurized suits but the pressure was not dangerous.
Captain not remembering the controls
Captain not sharing controls
Captain not sticking to one job but doing what he feels inclined to. Not doing as many chores.

The surface:
Stormy and dusty venus
bright and hot sun
jagged ruins
	
Life onboard:	
Chores
Free time
On the job

Captain negotiates orders to bring the convoy back
	Speeds ahead of the convoy and the convoy catches up

	He will face punishment if he returns to Black
	part of convoy lost
	
Pink:

White:
	
Edyth learns that Captain has a thing for her and that her looks were the reason she was selected. 
Captain does not recognize Edyth's achievements, intelligence, skill, nor experience.

During the expedition, Captain uses the opportunity to sleep around, to network for himself, to enjoy gifts, to play the hero, to see things he wants to see,
	
Everyone has gotten comfortable at this point. A regular day: Zack is not even pretending to do work and playing a game. Edyth is writing in her journal. Captain is watching an old movie about a pilot.

Life was hard in the cramped space with so many people, but the nice thing about having the whole team together was that the Captain would try to touch her less.
She missed her home, she missed her books, she missed her book club, her friends and colleagues and what they were trying to build together.
However, this was an opportunity to start over for the whole world --and to do it better.
Aside from the Captain, she liked having a team of experts together in one place, and the team had learned to function in spite of the Captain.
	
Captain was very bored one day and challenged Zack to a game of chess (yes, he was that bored). 
Zack beats him and then Captain would not let go of it and kept playing Zack over and over until Zack was sick of it. 
Eventually, Zack let him win.
	
Captain overhears his workers talking about him. He chooses to get furious, then will retaliate in some way. 

Zack reads conversations from other nations in forums and only pays attention to the parts that interest him.

marauders will try to break hazmat suits

Lessons:
what you gamble, you can lose
dont be careless
you can't be the hero sometimes
if you don't try hard enough, you can regret it later
God forgets no one
this planet is strange
	
Discovering the strangeness of the world: 
technology 
batteries - chemical reactions
communication  - how do we bridge these gaps?
fuel types - how do we go farther? exceed our capacity?
raw materials - 
fallout
underwater living
underground living
radon
carbon monoxide
co2 accumulation
methane, sulphur
vitamin deficiencies
	everything can be dangerous, life is fragile

understanding people after we've grown apart:
	reactions and societal standpoints:
	prioritize family, prioritize entertainment, laugh it off, party like there is no tomorrow,
	education and diplomacy, warefare and defense, control and medicine, technology and data, 
	inactivity, indecision, long for the good days, 
	manipulate others, reach for a crutch, use the geography to stay safe, panic, think harder, be stronger,
	hang onto culture and tradition, get comfortable, embrace death, be religious, elect a leader, pillage, 
we have to mistrust each other to survive, but when we work together, we can do impossible things.
We can make things impossible for each other, or we can work together and do the impossible
	
theres no point to anything, so might as well pick something to stand for and stand for it
at the end of life, people don't miss having more time by themselves or with their possessions, they miss time with loved ones
best to take things a day at a time when things are this bad. Maybe even a minute at a time.

	Edyth realizes shes tracing back the steps she and her family took when escaping green

Mutiny Scene:
Edyth builds up the courage to turn against the Captain.
The metal door of the vehicle is closed.
Never wanting to be the leader, Edyth realizes she should step up to be the leader.
The team has been complacent under Captain's leadership, too loyal to go against him, and too used to seeking his approval.
The Captain is shocked at his team, sees himself as having failed for being too slow to discipline them/too soft on them, questions his leadership, wonders if he actually is resposible for the way things have turned out
The Captain will realize that he acted selfishly. 
Edyth overcomes her compassion for him to discipline the Captain.
Edyth grapples with her feeling guilty for standing up to the Captain.
Edyth learns to trust herself that this was the best choice.
	
Zack: He told me not to say where he was.
Edyth: He didn't need to put that kind of pressure on you. I want you to know that it's okay to stand up to him.
	
Captain investigated the bag on the ground to find it contained his belongings. His eyes moved over the sand, to the vehicle, and to figure in the doorway.
Edyth's voice came on the intercom. You have operated outside the scope of the mission and you repeatedly put us in danger. 
You've made it clear that you don't have a shred of respect for anyone aside from yourself. 
So go now and do what you want. You are no longer our Captain.
He listened. He didn't try to walk up the ladder.
The metal door closed. The vehicle lurched forward and faded into the dust.

Captain looked up. The dusty yellow clouds swirled above his head, but he imagined that he could see through the clouds, through the atmosphere, and get a clear look at the stars.

At least now it wouldn't matter if he returned to the party, but that would prove her right.

Captain's new life:
Captain's early retirement to an agrarian society
Captain puts aside his needs for luxury
Captain adopts local beliefs (like someone trying Buddhism out to do a deep cleansing of their mind and gain a fresh start)
Captain settles for a simpler life
Captain is moved by the compassion that the locals have for him
The locals do not care about his past but see value in him on a personal level
Captain's status is no longer a factor, so Captain feels seen as a person.
Nathan sees him as old. Captain learns that it's time to grow up.
