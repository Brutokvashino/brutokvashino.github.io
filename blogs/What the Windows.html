PowerBI errors: (Solution made) 
How are you sharing the file to [name]? Are you dragging it somewhere, sharing through Teams, or sharing it through Sharepoint.  
The suggestion given to me was that you should share it from within PowerBI itself. 
As for how to open the files on your end, the suggestion was that you can open your Skip Report sharepoint from the File Explorer on your computer itself. 
Go to the sharepoint, click the Sync button from the options above. This will make the sharepoint appear on your File Explorer like its own folder. 
Problems may occur if multiple instances of a file are open. You may want to turn off the autosave feature and do a manual save when you want to update it. 

Outlook opens too slowly and emails get cut-off at the top: (Solution made) 
First, we cleared storage because we noticed she had <20 GB free. Cleared cached site data.  
Saw multiple instances saying that Outlook often causes problems on Chrome. 
Used a Microsoft support assistant tool (specifically for Outlook on the web) and after the process was complete, emails on Chrome seemed to be loading faster and fully. 
If the problem were to persist, using Outlook on Microsoft Edge would be the best bet.
