Learn to love learning. The more you can learn, the more you can do. Try to learn lessons from other people, but if you really feel the need to make your own mistakes, at least research what happened to people who tried a similar thing. 
Do your homework first. Treat learning like it's your job, because no matter what job you do, you will not keep it if you can't keep up.

Grow up fast!
