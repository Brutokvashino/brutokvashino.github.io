Learn to love learning. The more you can learn, the more you can do. Try to learn lessons from other people, but if you really feel the need to make your own mistakes, at least research what happened to people who tried a similar thing. 
Do your homework first. Treat learning like it's your job, because no matter what job you do, you will not keep it if you can't keep up.

Grow up fast!

Psychology, philosophy, 

Family:
Enmeshment: Detect it

Religion:
Do not impose your kind of discipline on others.
Makes this a difficult position for me because it's exactly what I'm doing here, and I should not.

Growing up:
Discipline:
Grow up asap.
Pursue disclipline, not happiness, not fun. Discipline creates character.
Discipline your words to use them carefully.
Break unhealhty attachments
I thought I was a good person.
A lot of my actions were based on fear.
Being reactive.
Complacency makes you think you are better than you are.
Diligence:
Finish chores first.
Adult life is energy-intensive, expensive, emotionally taxing, hard, sometimes isolating (if you don't have enough friends also in the grind), regimented, often leaves no time for games, but it's worth it!

Be a good husband:
Character: be a thoughtful husband, pursue your wife, be spontaneous, integrity, responsibility, passionate, dependable, disciplined, mature, strength, work hard, be astute, communicate, schedule, plan in advance, keep healthy habits, 
be a good provider, be smart where you put your resources.

Marriage:
Take on responsibility
Do the chores and seek more
Integrity:
Marriage is no place for privacy.
Act like everyone is watching --especially your wife.
Honesty:
Honesty is non-negotiable in a marriage.
White lies are full lies and the worst of humanity.
Withholding information is lying.
When you delay the truth, you're lying too.
A lie pulls someone high up by a flimsy string.
The shoe eventually drops on lies and bad patters/misdeeds.
The longer you go without telling the truth, the higher that rope pulls them up.
--lifting someone higher and higher just to drop them.
Positive:
Even bad experiences can forge good ones.

The Black Cat:
Maybe you're more of a dog person, but you should really have both sides. If you don't like cats or understand cats, you should know that they are precious little angel babies.
On the other end of the spectrum is the golden retriever. I'll mention the golden retriever later.
Travel:
If you want travel to just happen to you, it won't. Get serious about travel.
Money:
If you don't master it, money will slip from your hands like sand.
Practice good accounting.

Celebrate your victories: when you planned something that worked out, you worked hard for something that you achieved, success at your job, learning something, doing something you were afraid of, even doing your civic duty.
