Learn to love learning. The more you can learn, the more you can do. Try to learn lessons from other people, but if you really feel the need to make your own mistakes, at least research what happened to people who tried a similar thing. 
Do your homework first. Treat learning like it's your job, because no matter what job you do, you will not keep it if you can't keep up.

Grow up fast!

Pursue disclipline, not happiness. Discipline creates character.

Growing up:

Be a good husband:
Character: be a thoughtful husband, pursue your wife, be spontaneous, integrity, responsibility, passionate, dependable, disciplined, mature, strength, work hard, be astute, communicate, schedule, plan in advance, keep healthy habits, 
be a good provider, be smart where you put your resources.

The Black Cat:
Maybe you're more of a dog person, but you should really have both sides. If you don't like cats or understand cats, you should know that they are precious little angel babies.
On the other end of the spectrum is the golden retriever. I'll mention the golden retriever later.
Travel:
If you want travel to just happen to you, it won't. Get serious about travel.
Money:
If you don't master it, money will slip from your hands like sand.

Celebrate your victories: when you planned something that worked out, you worked hard for something that you achieved, success at your job, learning something, doing something you were afraid of, even doing your civic duty.
